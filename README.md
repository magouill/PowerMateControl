PowerMateControl is a Windows system tray application designed for Windows 11.  
It provides functionality for the Griffin PowerMate USB device, with no plans to support the Bluetooth version.

This program offers two distinct profiles:

- **Scroll**: Sends mouse scroll actions.  
- **Volume**: Controls the system volume (up, down, mute).
